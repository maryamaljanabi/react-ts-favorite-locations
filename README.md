# React Typescript Favorite Locations App

Work in progress...

- This project will not require login or backend/database to function.
- The main idea is using React.ts with OpenLayers for maps functionality and Tailwind CSS for the UI.
- Users will be able to see a map when they open the app and there will be a pin in the middle of the map with their location.
- They can search for nearby restaurants, markets, etc and add them to favorites. The favorites icon will float on the map and when clicked, it will show a side menu with all the favorite locations a user has added.
- Since there is no database involved, the favorites information for each user will be stored in the local storage of the browser.
- Responsive design.
- Adding unit tests.
- It is possible to add PWA feature.
